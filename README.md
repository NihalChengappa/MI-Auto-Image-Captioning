1.Download the flickr 8k dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityajn105/flickr8k.  
2.Extract the Images and Captions folder from it and save it in same directory as the ipynb code file.  
3.Create a new folder in same directory and name it "images_new" this will serve for saving new images which we want to generate captions for.  
4.Run the code file.  
5.To predict new images , every time a new image is updated in the images_new folder you will need to run the re-read the base and working
